## Summary - 

The Titanic ship sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg.

In the provided visualization, we see the likely effect of factors like age, gender and class on the status of survival of the passengers. We will start with gender, then we will add passengers’ age groups and classes to gender separately to see how these two combinations would affect survival rates. In the final step, we will add both age groups and classes together to gender in one visualization to get detailed insights on passengers’ survival rates. 

## Design - 

Throughout the visualization, we use only two colors blue and orange.
Justification: We do this because we want people with color blindness to have a clear view of our graphs. Which we achieve with  

The story consists of 6 pairs of slides. Each pair of slides includes a dashboard with some the factors in focus. The dashboard is split into two sides, the left side shows a plot before the accident which represent the total number of passengers and the right side show the same plot after the accident based on factors and split into two quarters based on the passengers’ status (survived or perished). 
Justification: This predictability helps the viewer develop the story as they read through the slides to arrive to the conclusion I aim to deliver.  

I limited the use of visualizations to bar charts and tables. 
In my study of the titanic data, the focus is basically on the count of people survived vs. perished, based on available data. Bar charts are best suited to show such a comparison between counts/frequency of occurrences of multiple categories. 

## Feedback:

The initial version of the visualization was shared with one of my colleagues. Below is the received feedback and the changes that I made based on the discussions we’ve had: 
1.	The starting slide in the story was a simple age distribution of the passengers, but the next slides showed a more meaningful classification of passengers by their age groups, so the feedback was that the first slide is not needed. As a result it was removed from the story. 
2.	The last two slides in the story provided two ways to look at the combination on 3 factors. This was confusing and the recommendation was to select only one of those two slides because they were basically communicating the same message. As a result, I kept one of the two slides, and replaced the other with a summary table to create 4 similar pairs of slides for every set of factors. 


## Resources:

The original data set used in this project was selected from the Data Set Options by Udacity. I made changes to the data set by grouping age, gender, class and survived dimensions and measures.
